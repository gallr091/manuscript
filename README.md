"Design Thinking is a Rebrand for White Supremacy" is an article written by designer Darin Buzon which critiques the concept of Design Thinking and how it fails to address the underlying issues of capitalism and colonialism in design. 

The article text has been typeset and coded by Rice Gallardo using HTML/CSS for their first project for Type and Interaction 1. It is a hybrid horizontal/vertical scrolling site meant to challenge traditional website designs, just as the article challenges "standard" design norms and practices. It draws inspiration from Bauhaus (modernist) aesthetics juxtaposed with elements of Filipino design, creating a unique reading experience that beckons its audience to put in a little extra effort to go through—just as marginalized designers and communities have had to put in extra effort in order to be seen and heard.
